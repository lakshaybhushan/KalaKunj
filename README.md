- The project involves creating an AR-based Cultural art Gallery using Blender for 3D modelling and Unity for development. It includes interactive features scripted in C#, providing cultural insights and multilingual support. The system uses Vuforia SDK facilitating a personalized gallery journey for each user. All these features aim to enhance user engagement and provide a rich cultural experience.
